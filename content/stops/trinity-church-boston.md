# Trinity Church Boston

## History

Trinity Church Boston is widely regarded as one of the finest examples of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture in the United States. Completed in **1877**, the church was designed by the legendary architect Henry Hobson Richardson, who considered it his masterpiece. It stands at the heart of Copley Square, directly across from the Boston Public Library, forming one of America's most celebrated civic spaces.

## Architectural Masterpiece

The church's design draws from French and Spanish Romanesque influences, featuring a massive central tower, broad rounded arches, and richly textured stonework. Richardson collaborated with the artist John La Farge to create an extraordinarily rich interior, filled with murals, stained glass windows, and decorative painting that transforms the space into a unified work of art. The building was listed as one of the ten greatest buildings in America by the American Institute of Architects.

## Founding and Early Years

The parish was founded in 1733, making it one of Boston's oldest Episcopal congregations. Under the transformative leadership of Phillips Brooks, who served as rector from 1869 to 1891, Trinity grew into a nationally influential congregation. Brooks is remembered as both a compelling preacher and the author of the beloved Christmas carol "O Little Town of Bethlehem."

## Cultural Significance

Trinity Church was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970. The church continues to draw thousands of visitors each year, offering tours of its remarkable interior. It remains an active Episcopal parish with a thriving musical program, community outreach initiatives, and a strong tradition of preaching and social engagement.
