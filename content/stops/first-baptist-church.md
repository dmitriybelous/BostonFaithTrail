# First Baptist Church in America

## History

The First Baptist Church in America traces its origins to **1638**, when Roger Williams founded the first Baptist congregation in Providence, Rhode Island. The Boston congregation, established in **1665**, is closely linked to this tradition and stands as one of the oldest Baptist churches in the country. The current building on Commonwealth Avenue was constructed in 1872 and is a celebrated example of Romanesque Revival architecture.

## Architectural Highlights

The church building, designed by H.H. Richardson — the same architect responsible for Trinity Church — features his distinctive Romanesque style with rough-hewn granite, rounded arches, and a dramatic corner tower. The frieze running around the exterior, known locally as "the church of the holy beanblowers," depicts figures with trumpets and was carved by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, the sculptor of the Statue of Liberty.

## Baptist Heritage

The Baptist tradition emphasizes the authority of Scripture, the importance of personal faith, believer's baptism by immersion, and the independence of local congregations. Boston's Baptist community played an important role in shaping American religious pluralism, particularly through its advocacy for religious liberty and the separation of church and state — principles championed by early Baptist leaders like Roger Williams.

## Present-Day Ministry

Today the First Baptist Church continues as an active congregation in the Back Bay neighborhood, offering worship, music programs, and community outreach. The building is a Boston Landmark and one of the most architecturally significant churches on Commonwealth Avenue. The congregation welcomes visitors and maintains a strong commitment to both its historic heritage and contemporary urban ministry.
