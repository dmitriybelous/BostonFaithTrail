# Old North Church

## History

Christ Church in the City of Boston, universally known as **Old North Church**, is the oldest surviving church building in Boston, completed in **1723**. Built in the Georgian style, it stands in the North End neighborhood and is famous worldwide for its role in the opening events of the American Revolutionary War.

## Paul Revere's Ride

On the night of April 18, 1775, church sexton Robert Newman climbed the steeple and hung two lanterns — the famous signal "one if by land, two if by sea" — to warn patriot militiamen in Charlestown that British troops were departing Boston by boat to march on Lexington and Concord. This act of courage helped set in motion Paul Revere's midnight ride and the battles that launched the American Revolution.

## Architectural Features

The church was designed by William Price, who drew inspiration from the London churches of Sir Christopher Wren. The soaring white steeple, rebuilt after being blown down in storms in 1804 and 1954, remains a defining feature of the Boston skyline. The interior features magnificent box pews, a historic pipe organ, and the original brass chandeliers donated in 1724.

## Living History

Today Old North Church is both an active Episcopal parish and one of Boston's most popular historic sites, welcoming over half a million visitors annually. The church offers guided tours, educational programs, and living history demonstrations that bring the colonial era to life. The adjacent garden features a monument to Paul Revere and a recreated colonial-era garden.
