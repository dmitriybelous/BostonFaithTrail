# Cathedral of the Holy Cross

## History

The Cathedral of the Holy Cross, located in the South End neighborhood of Boston, is the mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston and one of the largest Catholic churches in the United States. Completed in **1875**, the cathedral was designed by Patrick C. Keely in the Gothic Revival style and can accommodate approximately 3,500 worshippers.

## Scale and Architecture

When it was completed, the Cathedral of the Holy Cross was the largest Catholic church in the United States and remains an impressive structure to this day. The building stretches 364 feet in length and features soaring Gothic arches, magnificent stained glass windows, and intricate stone carving. The interior space is vast and awe-inspiring, designed to reflect the majesty of medieval European cathedrals.

## Irish Catholic Heritage

The cathedral stands as a monument to Boston's Irish Catholic community, which grew dramatically following the Great Famine of the 1840s. Hundreds of thousands of Irish immigrants settled in Boston, making the Catholic Church a central institution in the city's social and cultural life. The construction of the Cathedral of the Holy Cross represented the community's permanence and aspiration.

## Role in the Archdiocese

As the seat of the Archbishop of Boston, the Cathedral of the Holy Cross plays a central role in the spiritual life of over two million Catholics in eastern Massachusetts. It hosts major archdiocesan celebrations, ordinations, and significant religious events. The cathedral also serves the immediate South End community through an active parish and social outreach programs.
