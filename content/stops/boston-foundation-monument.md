## Key Points at a Glance

> Before you explore the full story of this memorial, here is a brief overview of what makes this stop significant on the Boston Faith Trail.

- **The Founders Memorial** is a 1930 bronze relief on Boston Common commemorating Boston's 300th anniversary, depicting the moment Reverend William Blaxton welcomed Governor John Winthrop to the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630.
- **Three key figures of faith** are immortalized in the relief: William Blaxton — Boston's first settler and Anglican minister; Reverend John Wilson — Boston's first Puritan pastor, shown holding a Bible; and Governor John Winthrop — whose "City on a Hill" sermon still echoes through American history.
- **The back of the monument** bears Winthrop's famous words from his 1630 sermon *A Modell of Christian Charity* — one of the most quoted passages in American political and religious history.
- **The ground beneath your feet** was once Blaxton's apple orchard — the first in America. The faith story of Boston begins here, with a solitary Anglican minister who chose to stay when everyone else went home.

## History of the Founders Memorial

Standing at the corner of Boston Common near Beacon Street, the Founders Memorial is one of the most historically layered monuments in all of New England. Formally titled *Founding of Boston*, the bronze relief was sculpted by John Francis Paramino and dedicated on September 16, 1930, as part of Boston's Tricentennial Celebration — the city's 300th birthday. The monument cost $45,000 at the time, equivalent to roughly $661,000 today.

The relief measures approximately 5.5 feet tall and 11 feet wide, set against a granite backdrop. It captures one of the most pivotal exchanges in American history: the moment that William Blaxton, Boston's first settler, greeted John Winthrop and the arriving Puritan colonists on the shores of the Shawmut Peninsula. In the scene, the two men reach toward each other in greeting — a symbolic transfer of land and of vision. In the background, the ship *Arabella* rests at anchor in the Charles River, having carried the Winthrop Fleet across the Atlantic.

Two Native American men are also present in the scene, witnessing the moment from the margins — a detail that has prompted reflection in recent years about whose voices are centered in the telling of Boston's founding. An allegorical female figure representing the city of Boston herself also appears in the composition.

Behind Winthrop, holding a Bible under his arm, stands Reverend John Wilson — Boston's first pastor — a figure whose quiet presence in the bronze speaks volumes about the role of faith in the founding of this city.

In recent years the monument has been the subject of creative reinterpretation. The Friends of the Public Garden selected it to pilot a public history initiative designed to reveal deeper histories, centering Indigenous histories and understandings of the Shawmut Peninsula alongside the more familiar colonial narrative.

## "A City Upon a Hill" — The Back of the Monument

Turn to the north face of the memorial, facing Beacon Street, and you will find two inscriptions that place this monument firmly in the center of the Boston Faith Trail.

The first is from Governor John Winthrop, written during his Atlantic crossing aboard the *Arabella* in 1630, in his sermon *A Modell of Christian Charity*:

> *"For wee must consider that wee shall be as a citty upon a hill. The eies of all people are uppon us, soe that if wee shall deale falsely with our God in this work…wee shall be made a story and a byword through the world."*
>
> — John Winthrop, 1630

The second inscription comes from Plymouth Colony Governor William Bradford:

> *"Thus out of smalle beginnings, greater things have been produced by His hand that made all things out of nothing…and as one small candle may light a thousand, so the light here kindled hath shone to many, yea, in some sorte to our whole nation."*
>
> — William Bradford

Together, these two inscriptions are not merely historical artifacts — they are a theological declaration. Winthrop's words expressed the Puritan conviction that their settlement would be a covenanted community, watched by God and the world alike. It was a vision freighted with both aspiration and accountability: *we will be watched, and we must not fail.* That vision became embedded in the American imagination, and it begins right here, carved in stone, on the back of this monument.

The monument's dedication inscription reads: *"In gratitude to God for the blessings enjoyed under a free government, the City of Boston has erected this memorial on the three hundredth anniversary of its founding — September 17th, 1630–1930."*

## The Figures of Faith — Brief Biographies

### Reverend William Blaxton (c. 1595–1675)

*The Lone Anglican*

In the bronze relief, Blaxton stands at the left, arm outstretched in welcome. He is the man who was already here — the solitary Anglican minister who had made a life on Shawmut Peninsula before the Puritans ever arrived, and whose invitation made Boston possible.

Born in Horncastle, Lincolnshire, England, Blaxton attended Emmanuel College, Cambridge, earning his Master of Arts in 1621. He was ordained as a priest of the Church of England in May 1619 and joined the failed Ferdinando Gorges expedition to America in 1623 as a chaplain. By 1625, when all his fellow travelers had returned to England, Blaxton refused to go. He moved five miles north to the rocky, mudflat-surrounded Shawmut Peninsula, becoming the first colonist to settle what would become Boston.

For more than five years, Blaxton lived alone on Shawmut. He built a hut on the southern slope of Beacon Hill, planted an apple orchard — the first in America — and amassed a collection of over 180 books, the largest private library in the colonies at the time.

When the Winthrop Fleet arrived in 1630, Blaxton invited the struggling settlers — suffering from lack of fresh water — to join him on Shawmut, where a clear spring ran. It was a gesture of extraordinary generosity that directly led to the founding of Boston.

What makes Blaxton especially compelling for a faith tour is his principled independence. He was an Anglican with no desire to conform to Puritan authority, and he ultimately left Boston rather than submit to it. Cotton Mather later recorded his famous words:

> *"I came from England because I did not like the lord-bishops; but I can't join with you, because I would not be under the lord-brethren."*
>
> — William Blaxton, as recorded by Cotton Mather

By 1635, Blaxton moved south to what is today Cumberland, Rhode Island, settling along the river now named the Blackstone River in his honor. He died on May 26, 1675, at the age of 80. He is considered by some historians to be the pioneer clergyman of the Protestant Episcopal Church in America.

### Reverend John Wilson (c. 1588–1667)

*Boston's First Pastor*

Look carefully at the figure standing directly behind Governor Winthrop in the memorial's bronze relief. The man holding the Bible under his arm is Reverend John Wilson — Boston's first pastor, and one of the most faithful and humble clergymen in colonial New England.

Born around 1588 in Windsor, England, the son of a canon of the church, Wilson studied at Eton and King's College, Cambridge, earning his bachelor's degree in 1610 and his master's in 1613. Though he had intended to follow his father into the established church, his conversion to Puritanism cost him his fellowship at King's College and put him at odds with ecclesiastical authorities who frequently silenced his preaching.

Persecution ultimately drove Wilson toward the New World. He sailed with his close friend John Winthrop and the Winthrop Fleet in 1630. The settlers established themselves first in Charlestown before crossing the Charles River into Boston in search of fresh water. On November 23, 1630, Wilson was officially installed as the minister of the First Church of Boston — a position he would hold for 37 years, until his death in 1667, making him one of the longest-serving ministers in Boston's history.

Wilson was also remarkably humble. He refused throughout his life to ever have his portrait painted, saying:

> *"What! Such a poor vile creature as I am! Shall my picture be drawn? I say No; it never shall."*
>
> — Reverend John Wilson

The great irony, of course, is that he was immortalized anyway — cast in bronze, Bible in hand, on Boston Common. He is also notable as one of the first Protestant missionaries to Native Americans in North America, visiting communities, helping the sick, and teaching those he could reach — work later expanded by Reverend John Eliot.

Wilson died on August 7, 1667, in the seventy-ninth year of his age. As he neared death, he raised his hands toward heaven and called out the names of old friends and fellow ministers he would soon see again. He is buried at King's Chapel Burying Ground — just a short walk from where you now stand.

### Governor John Winthrop (1588–1649)

*The Man Who Dreamed of a City on a Hill*

He is the central figure in the Founders Memorial bronze relief — the man reaching forward to take Blaxton's hand. But John Winthrop was far more than a governor. He was a man of deep, covenantal faith whose vision of what America could be still echoes through political speeches to this very day.

Born in Edwardstone, Suffolk, England, Winthrop attended Trinity College and later received legal training at Gray's Inn. He was rising in English legal circles when, uneasy about the government's hostility toward Puritanism and disturbed by what he saw as the corruption of English society, he helped negotiate a charter forming the Massachusetts Bay Company. In 1629, he was elected governor of the new colony. He would serve as governor twelve times between 1631 and 1648.

Winthrop set sail on April 8, 1630, from the Isle of Wight. He and his sons Samuel and Stephen were aboard the *Arabella*, which led three other ships on the initial voyage — eventually carrying an estimated 700 to 1,000 people to the New World. It was during this Atlantic crossing — before he ever saw Boston — that Winthrop delivered the sermon that would define his legacy forever.

In *A Modell of Christian Charity*, Winthrop compared the Puritan exodus to the story of Israel leaving Egypt. He described the future colony as an ideal godly society, bound to one another and to God by sacred covenant. Drawing on Jesus's words in Matthew 5:14, he declared that their settlement "shall be as a city upon a hill" — watched by all the eyes of the world. The sermon was not political poetry. It was a solemn covenant: *we have made a promise to God, and the world will see whether we keep it.*

Winthrop led by example, building his own home alongside other colonists and bearing the same hardships of the early years. He died on March 26, 1649, in Boston — the city he had conjured from faith, vision, and a sermon preached on the open sea.

Though largely unnoticed at the time, Winthrop's "City on a Hill" sermon was published in the 1830s and became a touchstone of American national identity. Since then it has been quoted by presidents from John F. Kennedy to Ronald Reagan. The man whose hand reaches toward Blaxton in this memorial spoke words that still shape how America understands itself.

## Tour Guide Tips

- **Point visitors to Reverend John Wilson** in the bronze relief and ask: *"Can you find the man holding the Bible?"* Then share his story — the man who refused to have his portrait painted ended up immortalized in bronze anyway.
- **Ask visitors:** *"When you look at the man shaking hands in this memorial, you are looking at the man whose words presidents still quote nearly 400 years later."* Then bring them to the back of the monument where those very words are carved in stone.
- **Remind visitors:** the very ground beneath Boston Common was once Blaxton's garden and apple orchard. The faith story of Boston begins not with the Puritans, but with a solitary Anglican minister who chose to stay.
- **John Wilson is buried at King's Chapel Burying Ground** — just a short walk away. Consider making that a seamless next stop on the trail.
