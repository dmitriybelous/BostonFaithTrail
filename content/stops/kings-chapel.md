# King's Chapel

## History

King's Chapel stands as a landmark of both religious and architectural history in Boston. The original wooden chapel was built in **1686** by order of Sir Edmund Andros, the Royal Governor of Massachusetts, making it the first Anglican church in Boston. The current granite structure, designed by Peter Harrison, was completed in 1754 and is considered one of the finest examples of Georgian ecclesiastical architecture in America.

## Religious Transformation

King's Chapel holds a unique place in American religious history. After the American Revolution, when the Anglican clergy departed with the British forces, the congregation reorganized and in 1785 became the first Unitarian congregation in the United States. This transition marked a significant moment in American religious liberalism and the development of Unitarianism as a distinct theological tradition.

## Architectural Significance

The building's architect, Peter Harrison, is often called America's first professional architect. The chapel features massive Ionic columns, a Georgian interior with box pews, and a historic pulpit that dates to 1717. The adjacent King's Chapel Burying Ground, dating to 1630, is Boston's oldest cemetery and contains the graves of numerous colonial-era figures, including John Winthrop and William Dawes.

## Musical Heritage

King's Chapel has a distinguished musical heritage, with one of the oldest continuous organ traditions in America. The current tracker organ was built in 1964 and is renowned for its exceptional quality. The chapel continues to offer regular choral and organ concerts, maintaining its role as a center of sacred music in Boston.
