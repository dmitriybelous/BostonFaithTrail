# Statue of Mary Dyer

## Overview

The Statue of Mary Dyer stands outside the Massachusetts State House and honors one of colonial New England’s most remembered advocates for freedom of conscience. Dyer, a Quaker, was executed in Boston in 1660 after repeatedly returning to protest laws that punished her religious beliefs.

## Historical Significance

Mary Dyer’s story is tied to early debates over religious liberty in Massachusetts. Over time, she came to symbolize resistance to state-enforced religion and the right to dissent. The statue’s location at Beacon Hill places this memory directly alongside the political center of the Commonwealth.

## What to Notice

Take time to read nearby inscriptions and then walk toward Tremont and School Streets. You can connect this stop to King’s Chapel, the Irish Famine Memorial, and Old South Meeting House to see how different eras of conscience, migration, and reform overlap in downtown Boston.
