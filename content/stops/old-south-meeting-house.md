# Old South Meeting House

## Overview

Old South Meeting House, completed in 1729, is one of Boston’s most important historic gathering spaces. It served both as a church and as a public forum where colonists debated British policy in the years leading up to the American Revolution.

## Revolutionary Era Role

Large public meetings held here in 1773 are closely linked to the events that led to the Boston Tea Party. Because of this, Old South Meeting House remains a key stop for visitors tracing the city’s political and religious history together.

## Today

The building now operates as a museum and educational site. Its downtown location makes it easy to pair with nearby stops such as the Irish Famine Memorial, King’s Chapel, and Tremont Temple to compare different periods of Boston’s civic and faith life.
