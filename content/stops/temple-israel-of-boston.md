# Temple Israel of Boston

## History

Temple Israel of Boston is one of New England's oldest and largest Reform Jewish congregations, founded in **1854**. From its earliest days as a small gathering of Jewish immigrants, the congregation has grown into a vibrant community that plays a leading role in Boston's religious and civic life. The temple is located in the Longwood Medical Area of the Fenway neighborhood.

## Reform Jewish Tradition

Temple Israel embraces the Reform Jewish tradition, which emphasizes the evolving nature of Jewish law and practice, the importance of social justice, and the integration of Jewish life with contemporary culture. The congregation has been a progressive voice in Boston's religious community for over 165 years, advocating for civil rights, interfaith cooperation, and social equality.

## Social Justice Legacy

Throughout its history, Temple Israel has been deeply committed to social justice. Members of the congregation were active in the Civil Rights Movement, and Rabbi Roland Gittelsohn, who served the temple from 1953 to 1977, was a prominent civil rights leader. His eulogy at Iwo Jima in 1945 became one of the most celebrated addresses of World War II, honoring fallen soldiers of all faiths and backgrounds.

## Community and Cultural Programs

Today Temple Israel serves thousands of families through worship, education, and community programs. The temple operates an active religious school, sponsors numerous cultural and educational events, and maintains partnerships with other faith communities across Boston. Its building on Longwood Avenue features a striking modernist sanctuary and is a center of Jewish cultural life in the Greater Boston area.
