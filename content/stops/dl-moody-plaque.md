# DL Moody Plaque

## Overview

The DL Moody Plaque on Court Street marks the Boston site associated with Dwight L. Moody’s conversion experience in 1855. Moody later became one of the best-known evangelical preachers of the 19th century.

## Historical Context

Before his national ministry, Moody worked in Boston and was influenced by local church and Sunday school life. The plaque connects the city’s street-level religious history with wider movements in American Protestantism, revivalism, and urban mission work.

## Why This Stop Fits the Trail

This marker represents the quieter side of faith heritage: not a large sanctuary, but a small place-memory tied to a major figure. It adds balance to the trail by highlighting how individual turning points can shape broader religious history.
