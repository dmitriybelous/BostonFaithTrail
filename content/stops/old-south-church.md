# Old South Church

## History

Old South Church, located at Copley Square in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood, is one of the most architecturally distinguished religious buildings in New England. The current building was completed in **1875** and is the third meetinghouse of the Old South congregation, founded in 1669. The church was designed by the architectural firm of Cummings and Sears in the Northern Italian Gothic style, featuring a distinctive campanile (bell tower) that has become an iconic element of the Copley Square skyline.

## Architectural Significance

The building showcases remarkable craftsmanship, including intricate stonework, stunning stained glass windows, and a soaring interior that draws visitors from around the world. The tower rises 246 feet above Copley Square and remains one of Boston's most recognizable landmarks. The interior features ornate woodwork, mosaic tile floors, and a magnificent pipe organ.

## Role in Boston History

The Old South congregation has played a significant role in Boston's civic and religious life for over three centuries. During the colonial era, the Old South Meeting House (a separate building in downtown Boston) served as a gathering place for revolutionary activities, including the planning of the Boston Tea Party in 1773. The congregation moved to its current Copley Square location after outgrowing the downtown meetinghouse.

## Community Today

Today, Old South Church is an active congregation within the United Church of Christ, welcoming visitors and worshippers from all backgrounds. The church hosts concerts, community events, and continues its long tradition of social justice advocacy. It is a National Historic Landmark and a beloved part of Boston's cultural heritage.
