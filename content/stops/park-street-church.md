## History

Park Street Church holds a prominent position at the corner of Park and Tremont Streets, overlooking the Boston Common. Founded in **1809**, it is one of Boston's most historically significant evangelical Protestant churches. The church's white steeple, rising 217 feet above street level, has been a landmark feature of downtown Boston for over two centuries.

On July 4, 1829, William Lloyd Garrison delivered his first public antislavery address from the church's pulpit, helping to launch the American abolitionist movement. The famous patriotic song "America" ("My Country, 'Tis of Thee") was first publicly performed here on July 4, 1831, by a children's choir.
