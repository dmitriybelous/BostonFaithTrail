# Saint Paul's Cathedral

## History

Saint Paul's Cathedral is an Episcopal cathedral church located on Tremont Street, directly across from Boston Common. Built in **1820**, it is one of the earliest examples of Greek Revival architecture in New England and stands as an important landmark on Boston's downtown landscape. The cathedral serves as the seat of the Episcopal Bishop of Massachusetts.

## Greek Revival Architecture

The building was designed by Alexander Parris, one of the leading architects of Federal-period Boston, who also designed Quincy Market. Saint Paul's features a grand Ionic portico with six massive columns, a style inspired by ancient Greek temples. The exterior's restrained classical elegance reflects the early 19th-century ideal of civic and religious buildings as embodiments of republican virtue.

## Episcopal Diocese

As a cathedral church, Saint Paul's plays a central role in the life of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, which encompasses over 170 congregations across eastern Massachusetts. The cathedral hosts diocesan events, ordinations, and special services throughout the church year. Its location at the edge of Boston Common makes it a visible symbol of the Episcopal tradition's deep roots in Boston's history.

## Arts and Music

Saint Paul's has a distinguished tradition of sacred music and the arts. The cathedral choir performs regularly at services and special events, and the building hosts concerts and cultural programs that bring together people of diverse backgrounds. The cathedral's commitment to beauty in worship reflects the broader Anglican tradition of using art, music, and architecture to express the transcendence of God.
